# Single-cell analysis identifies antigen presenting neutrophils in guttate psoriasis and a potential link to streptococcal pharyngitis

This git repository contains all R codes used for single cell data analysis for our recent manscript. 

**Blood Skin merged V3.R** In this R code we take "Skin_Blood_Merged.rds", "Blood_FINAL.rds" and "SKIN_FINAL.rds" as input and produce some output for running CellPhoneDB code.

**batch_cellphoned_all_combined.sh** This file contains the code for running CellPhoneDB. Here we have used Uppmax Rackham cluster to run the code.
